I'm a data scientist at Media Ad Data Team, [LY Corporation](https://www.lycorp.co.jp/en/), specializing in advertising-related analysis for [LINE NEWS](https://news.line.me/about/) and [SmartCH](https://guide.line.me/ja/services/smartchannel.html). I aim to provide insights that balance revenue and user experience, aiding in strategic decision-making.

Recently, I've been involved in challenging projects such as optimizing advertising strategies in SmartCH and improving data engineering solutions using Airflow. I actively participate in early-stage planning discussions, providing immediate numerical data and dashboards to assist planner's decision.

Working with a diverse team of data scientists, planners, software engineers, and members from various cultural backgrounds, I continue to enhance my skills and broaden my perspective in data science.
